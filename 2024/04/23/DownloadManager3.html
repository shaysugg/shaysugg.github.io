<meta name="description" content="In the past series (part1, part2) we went through how we can build a DownloadManager that has modern concurrency-friendly apis and capable of pausing and resuming failed and canceled downloads. In this article we will take a look at how we can add background download capability into our DownloadManager. Background download support is crucial for downloading large files. Many users may exit our app while a downloads is in progress, causing our app to enter a suspended state However users will expect the ongoing downloads to resume seamlessly. Fortunately supporting background downloads is not overly complicated, So let’s see how we we can implement this feature. Background Download Capability The initial step in supporting background downloads is to define a dedicated URLSession with background configuration. class DownloadManager: NSObject, URLSessionDownloadDelegate { //... lazy private var backgroundDownloadSession: URLSession = { let config = URLSessionConfiguration.background() config.isDiscretionary = false config.sessionSendsLaunchEvents = true let session = URLSession( configuration: config, delegate: downloadDelegate, delegateQueue: nil ) return session }() } isDiscretionary flag should be set to true for large file downloads with lower priority so the system may schedule the download based on various device conditions. However, in our case, if the app goes into the background, we often want the ongoing download to resume as soon as possible. Therefore, it’s been set to false. Now we have to define a method that uses our background configured session to download files: ```swift func backgroundDownload( from url: URL, earliestBeginDate: Date = Date.now, countOfBytesClientExpectsToReceive: Int64? = nil, ) -&gt; DownloadTask { let task = backgroundDownloadSession.downloadTask( with: URLRequest(url: url)) task.earliestBeginDate = earliestBeginDate if let countOfBytesClientExpectsToReceive { task.countOfBytesClientExpectsToReceive = countOfBytesClientExpectsToReceive }" />

<h1>Download Manager - Part 3 - Background downloads</h1>
<p>In the past series (<a href="https://shaysugg.github.io//2024/04/06/DownloadManager1.html">part1</a>, <a href="https://shaysugg.github.io//2024/04/21/DownloadManager2.html">part2</a>) we went through how we can build a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DownloadManager</code> that has modern concurrency-friendly apis and capable of pausing and resuming failed and canceled downloads.
In this article we will take a look at how we can add background download capability into our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DownloadManager</code>. Background download support is crucial for downloading large files. Many users may exit our app while a downloads is in progress, causing our app to enter a suspended state However users will expect the ongoing downloads to resume seamlessly. Fortunately supporting background downloads is not overly complicated, So let’s see how we we can implement this feature.</p>
<h2 id="background-download-capability">Background Download Capability</h2>
<p>The initial step in supporting background downloads is to define a dedicated <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">URLSession</code> with background configuration.</p>
<div class="language-swift highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">class</span> <span class="kt">DownloadManager</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">NSObject</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">URLSessionDownloadDelegate</span> <span class="p">{</span>

    <span class="k">let</span> <span class="nv">session</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kt">URLSession</span><span class="p">(</span>

<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isDiscretionary</code> flag should be set to true for large file downloads with lower priority so the system may schedule the download based on various device conditions. However, in our case, if the app goes into the background, we often want the ongoing download to resume as soon as possible. Therefore, it’s been set to false.
Now we have to define a method that uses our background configured session to download files:</p>
<div class="language-swift highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">func</span> <span class="nf">backgroundDownload</span><span class="p">(</span>

<span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="kt">DownloadTask</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">let</span> <span class="nv">task</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">backgroundDownloadSession</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nf">downloadTask</span><span class="p">(</span>
    <span class="nv">with</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">URLRequest</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">url</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">url</span><span class="p">))</span>
  
  <span class="n">task</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">earliestBeginDate</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">earliestBeginDate</span>
  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="k">let</span> <span class="nv">countOfBytesClientExpectsToReceive</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">task</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">countOfBytesClientExpectsToReceive</span> <span class="o">=</span>
    <span class="n">countOfBytesClientExpectsToReceive</span> 
  <span class="p">}</span>

  <span class="k">let</span> <span class="nv">downloadTask</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kt">DownloadTask</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">urlSessionTask</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">task</span><span class="p">)</span>

  <span class="n">task</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nf">resume</span><span class="p">()</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">downloadTask</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This method implementation is similar to our regular download method that we implemented in <a href="/2024/04/06/DownloadManager1.html">part1</a> but with additional configurations. We capture <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">earliestBeginDate</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">countOfBytesClientExpectsToReceive</code> parameters and pass them to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DownloadTask</code>.</p>
<h3 id="handling-app-suspension">Handling app suspension</h3>
<p>If our app gets suspended in the background, our background downloads may continue in another process. When they’re finished, the system resumes the app and notify that the download is finished by calling this method in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AppDelegate</code>:</p>
<div class="language-swift highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">func</span> <span class="nf">application</span><span class="p">(</span>
 <span class="n">_</span> <span class="nv">application</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">UIApplication</span><span class="p">,</span>
 <span class="n">handleEventsForBackgroundURLSession</span>
 <span class="nv">identifier</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">String</span><span class="p">,</span>
 <span class="nv">completionHandler</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kd">@escaping</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="kt">Void</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>We should store the completion handler in our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DownloadManager</code> and call it when this <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">URLSessionDelegate</code> method is being called.</p>
<div class="language-swift highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">func</span> <span class="nf">urlSessionDidFinishEvents</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">forBackgroundURLSession</span> <span class="nv">session</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kt">URLSession</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There are several good points related to background downloading have been mentioned in this <strong>SwiftLee</strong> blog post. Definitely worth to check them out.
 <a href="https://www.avanderlee.com/swift/urlsession-common-pitfalls-with-background-download-upload-tasks/">URLSession: Common pitfalls with background download &amp; upload tasks</a></p>

<p>In the next article, I’m going to explain potential concurrency problems that we may face with the current implementation of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DownloadManager</code> and why it’s recommended to consider our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DownloadManager</code> to be an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">actor</code>.</p>

<p>The complete implementation of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DownloadManager</code> is available on <a href="https://gist.github.com/shaysugg/8def3de858038eccf1ab2860424336e0">Gist</a>.</p>
